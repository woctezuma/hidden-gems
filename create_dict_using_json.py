# Objective: store information regarding every Steam game in a dictionary.
#
# Input:
#
# - a text file, manually copied from SteamDB, named "top_rated_games_on_steam.txt"
input_filename = "top_rated_games_on_steam.txt"
steamdb_url = "https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/?all"
# NB: To download & copy the content of input_filename by yourself, you need to log in using your own Steam account on
#     steamdb_url and then select to show all in the dropdown menu.
#
# - a json file, downloaded from SteamSpy, named "steamspy.json"
json_filename = "steamspy.json"
steamspy_url = "http://steamspy.com/api.php?request=all"
# NB: If json_filename is missing, the current script will attempt to download and cache it from steamspy_url.
#
# Output:
#
# a dictionary stored in a text file named "dict_top_rated_games_on_steam.txt"
output_filename = "dict_top_rated_games_on_steam.txt"
